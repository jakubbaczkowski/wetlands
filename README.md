# Wetland Web Application with GeoDjango
This project developed a web-based solution for managing a knowledge base derived from over 600 scientific publications. The knowledge base is cataloged, tagged, and its research areas are georeferenced. The application allows users to search, visualize, and update the collected knowledge (literature).

## Technologies Used:
### Django/Python:
Backend development was implemented using the Django framework with Python, providing a robust and scalable solution for managing the database, serving web requests, and creating endpoints for the API.

### GeoDjango: 
Used to display georeferenced data on a map, particularly for visualizing wetlands.

### PostgreSQL: 
The PostgreSQL database was employed for storing and managing the vast collection of scientific publications and associated metadata.

### Docker: 
The application was containerized using Docker, facilitating easy deployment and management.

## Project Scope:
- Data Migration: Migrated data from an existing Excel sheet to the PostgreSQL database and created an endpoint to upload new data.
- Map Visualization: Displayed all data on a map using GeoDjango, allowing users to visualize research areas.
- Search and Filter: Enabled users to search and filter the data through the web application interface.
- Admin Panel: Developed an admin panel for managing the application and its data.
- User Database: Implemented a database for user management and authentication.

## Project Management:
- Group Project: This project was developed collaboratively by a team.
- Scrum Methodology: Conducted weekly Scrum sessions and consultations with the client to ensure alignment with project goals and requirements.
- Version Control: Utilized feature branches on GitHub, merging into a single version on a weekly basis to integrate new features and updates.
